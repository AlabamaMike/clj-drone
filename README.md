# clj-drone

Why wouldn't you want to control your AR Drone with your Clojure REPL?

A Clojure library to control the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 [http://ardrone2.parrot.com/](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/)

## Usage

Just beginning the start of the control library, so far only take-off,
land and emergency landing are implemented.

More to come soon.

     (initialize)
     (drone :take-off)
     (drone :land)
     (drone :emergency)
